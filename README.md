Whack-A-RAT game instruction:

1. See the rat.
2. Whack the rat.
3.You're done.

...

Actually, there's something more than that, so let's try again :)

1. Hit the START button on the menu screen.
2. Now you are on a game screen, which looks like a comfy class room, probably the one from a Mayden Academy. There are 6 pretty desks. Rats will appear from behind the desks.
2. To let you get ready for hitting rats, the countdown timer will count 3...2...1...GO!
3. Once a countdown is finished, rats will start randomly appear on their desks.
4. Make rats disappear simply clicking on any part of them. Even whiskers are in the game >.<
5. All rats you miss will stay for 1 second and then disappear themselves.
6. Each rat you hit will bring you 1 point. 
7. You could see your score in a top right corner of a game screen. Don't look there though, concentrate on rats, because...
8. every 5 seconds the game will become more challenging and more rats will appear, try your best to whack them all, AND....
9. remember, you will only have 30 seconds to become a Whack-A-RAT world champion. Once 30 seconds timer is ran out, the game will stop and you will see your impressing  final score and sucsess rate. 

Thank you for reading. 

Now, let's whack some rats !

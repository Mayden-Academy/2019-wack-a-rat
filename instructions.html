        <h2>game instructions:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>1. See the rat.<br>
            2. Whack the rat.<br>
            3.You're done.<br>
            ...<br>

            Actually, there's something more than that, so let's try again :)<br>

            1. Hit the START button on the menu screen.<br>
            2. Now you are on a game screen, which looks like a comfy class room, probably the one from Mayden Academy. There are 6 pretty desks. Rats will appear from behind the desks.<br>
            3. To let you get ready for hitting rats, the countdown timer will count 3...2...1...GO!<br>
            4. Once a countdown is finished, rats will start randomly appear on their desks.<br>
            5. Make rats disappear simply clicking on any part of them. Even whiskers are in the game >.<<br>
            6. All rats you miss will stay for 1 second and then disappear themselves.<br>
            7. Each rat you hit will bring you 1 point.<br>
            8. You could see your score in a top right corner of a game screen. Don't look there though, concentrate on rats, because...<br>
            9. every 5 seconds the game will become more challenging and more rats will appear, try your best to whack them all, AND....<br>
            10. remember, you will only have 30 seconds to become a Whack-A-RAT world champion. Once 30 seconds are up, the game will stop and you will see your impressive final score and success rate.<br>

            Thank you for reading.<br>

            Now, let's whack some rats !</p>
